Making changes:

If you are planning to translate a seen, move it into the in-progress TL folder. This prevents people from accidentally translating the same scene.



Scene Translation:

Move the scene you want to translate to your folder, and begin translating. At the top of the file, place a line that says
// Translator: *Your Name*

To add comments, type // at the start of a new line, and type in your comment.
If you are struggling to translate a line, or are unsure of your translation, add a comment that says
// TLCHECK

Once you have finished with the scene, you should move it to the QC folder.



Quality Checking:

Look out for any typos, grammar fragments, and confusing sentences. If there is a sentence or phrase that relies heavily on Japanese Culture, note down either in the file or in the forum topic. We can then discuss on how best to explain the cultural reference.





Image Translations:

Create a text file with the same name as the g00 file you are translating, and write the translations there.
